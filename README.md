# The Consumer Behavior and Shopping Habits: A Deep Dive into Customer Choices
Understanding and predicting consumer purchasing behavior is crucial for businesses aiming to enhance their marketing strategies and increase sales. With the advent of machine learning and web technologies, it is now possible to build applications that can analyze consumer data and predict purchasing behavior with high accuracy. This paper presents a Django web application designed to predict whether a consumer's purchase behavior will be high or low, based on various input features.

The models we trained are Naive Bayes, Support Vector Classifier(svm), Random Forest Classifier, Logistic Regression, K-nearest neighbours(KNN), Gradient Boosting, Ada Boost and Decision Tree .
